# JavaScript Notes

These are my notes that I made while brushing up on JS. Each section is outlined here, and there are examples in the javascript file.

## Basics

### Types

There are 5 basic primitive types along with two other less used type:

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

**Variables are able to change type in JS. But that isn't always a good thing.**

### Variables

There are two common ways to create variables in JS, `let` and `const`. We camelCase for variables in JS. We can only have one of a variable in a given scope. Variables declared with `const` can't be updated.

`var` was the old way that was used to create variables. There is basically no good reason to use it over `let` and `const`.

### Unary Operators

We can use `++`, `+=` and other such syntax.

### Booleans

These are values that are either `true` of `false`. These pop up a lot. However, they operate the same way that booleans
operate in other languages.
